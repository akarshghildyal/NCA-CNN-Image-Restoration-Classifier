## üå± Project Motivation
Damaged or incomplete images‚Äîcommon in real-world data due to sensor noise, transmission errors, or masking‚Äîsignificantly reduce the accuracy of standard classification models. Traditional restoration methods often lack **adaptability and interpretability**.

This project tackles this challenge by introducing an **emergent AI system** that autonomously learns image reconstruction rules. We merge the self-organizing capabilities of **Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)** with the robust feature extraction of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to dramatically enhance classification accuracy on damaged inputs.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture
The system functions as a streamlined, end-to-end pipeline visualized in a real-time Streamlit application.

| Pipeline Step | Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Input & Masking** | Data Loader | Captures Fashion-MNIST or user-uploaded images and applies a customizable **random masking ratio** (e.g., 40%) to simulate damage. |
| **2. NCA Reconstruction** | `NeuralCA` | Iteratively reconstructs the missing spatial information over configurable steps (e.g., 40 steps). Each pixel acts as a mini-agent, using $3 \times 3$ convolutions for neighborhood perception to drive complex, **emergent** formation of the missing content. |
| **3. CNN Classification** | `SimpleCNN` | The final reconstructed, clean image is passed to a CNN for highly accurate 10-class prediction. |

## üìä Performance Insight
The model demonstrates effective performance on the masked **Fashion-MNIST** dataset:
* **Dataset**: Fashion-MNIST (70,000 images across 10 fashion categories).
* **Input Damage**: 40% random masking applied to test robustness.
* **Classification Accuracy**: Achieved approximately **85%** accuracy on the reconstructed images.
